### Problem Statement  
  - Getting the best neighborhood for upcoming students in Chicago based on a data-driven  multiple-tags based recommendation system (RecSys), where tags are context-aware.

### Solution
  - Using an AI-based model at the core to handle the data and make predictions and then there is a map where we can portray those insights and based on the preference a student can select which neighborhood he/she prefers.
